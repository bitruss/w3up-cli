> w3up-cli is a command-line interface for the W3up platform by Dag.House. You can use the cli to do things like generate an identity, register, upload assets, list your uploads and more!

### üè† [Homepage](https://github.com/web3-storage/w3up-cli)

## Installation

Install from github:

```sh
npm install -g git@github.com:web3-storage/w3up-cli.git
```

Install from Npm

```sh
npm install -g w3up
```

## Usage

Running the `w3up` command with no arguments will show an overview of the [Quickstart](#quickstart) flow, which you'll want to follow when you're first getting set up.

### Quickstart

The "Quickstart" flow is outlined when you run `w3up` without giving it a command:

```sh
w3up
```

You should see something like the following:

```
Quickstart:
1. Generate Your identity
	- w3up id 			Create an id
	- w3up register <email> 	Register
2. Upload to W3 Up
	- w3up upload <filename> 	Upload a file or directory
3. Verify
	- w3up list 			View your upload

w3up

Options:
  --version  Show version number                                       [boolean]
  --help     Show help                                                 [boolean]export-settings
```

To complete the quickstart flow, you'll need to use a few commands:

1. [`w3up id`](#id) generates a new identity keypair.
1. [`w3up register`](#register) associates your email address with your new identity key and grants access to the service.
1. [`w3up upload`](#upload) uploads files and directories.
1. [`w3up list`](#list) shows information about your uploads.

## Commands

This section covers the most important commands available in `w3up`. For a complete list, run `w3up --help`.

```sh
w3up --help
```

An example of the current output is shown below, but please note that we're rapidly improving `w3up`, and there may be some delay between changes in the code and updates to this README. If you notice that they have diverged before we do, please [open an issue][new-gh-issue] and let us know!

  w3up generate-car ../duck.png duck.car  CAR created ../duck.png => duck.ca
```


### Registration

Most of the commands in `w3up` require a registered identity keypair.

Registration is a two-step process:

1. [`w3up id`](#id) generates a new identity keypair.
2. [`w3up register`](#register) associates the identity key with your email address.

Once registered, you can verify that your identity has been registered using [`w3up whoami`](#whoami), which displays the id for your w3up account.

#### `id`

> Displays your identity keypair, creating it if it does not yet exist.

```sh
w3up id
```

On first run, generates the public and private key pairs necessary to work with the underlying [UCAN ](https://ucan.xyz/) authorization system.

Running `w3up id` a second time will load your key from disk instead of generating a new one.

You can validate you are registered!

If you have generated the id properly, you'll see your `did:key` printed in the command line. It should look like `did:bafy....`.

#### `register`

> Registers your identity with the w3up service.

```sh
w3up register you@example.com
```

After you've generated an identity, you need to register it with the w3up service. The `w3up register` command will display a message asking you to check your email. Once you click the activation link in the email, the `w3up register` command will complete the registration process and show a success message. 

_Note: Remember to check your spam folder if you suspect you never got the email_

#### `whoami`

> Displays the identifier for your w3up account.

```sh
w3up whoami
```

The `whoami` command displays an identifier for your w3up account. Note that this may differ from your identity key in cases where you have registered multiple identities to the same account.

### General Usage

After creating your identity and registering with w3up, you should be able to start using the service. The main commands you'll use are:

1. [`w3up upload`](#upload)
2. [`w3up list`](#list)
3. [`w3up remove`](#remove)

#### `upload`

```sh
w3up upload <filename>
```

Uploads a file or directory and link it to your account. The second argument is the path to that file or directory.

**Important:** All data uploaded using `w3up` is made available to anyone who requests it using the correct [CID][concepts-cid]. Do not upload sensitive or private data in unencrypted form!

> üìù If you are uploading thousands of small files, it's faster to put them together into a directory and upload that, than to invoke this CLI with thousands of individual files.

#### `list`

> Prints a list of [CIDs][concepts-cid] for all files uploaded thus far.

```sh
w3up list
```

#### `remove`

> Unlinks an uploaded CID, disassociating it from your account.

```sh
w3up remove <cid>
```

This will dis-associate an uploaded asset from your account. If you run `w3up list` after unlinking a file, you should not see it in the list. If you want to re-associate the file with your account, use `w3up upload` and re-upload the file. In situations when a file has been previously uploaded, the upload command will not need to actually upload the file, it will just relink it.

**Important:** `w3up remove` does not delete your data from the public IPFS network, Filecoin, or other decentralized storage systems used by w3up. Data that has been `remove`d and is not linked to any other accounts _may_ eventually be deleted from the internal storage systems used by the w3up service, but there are no guarantees about when (or whether) that will occur, and you should not depend on data being permanently deleted.

### Settings management

There are a few commands for working with your settings.

Settings are stored in a binary configuration file in a `w3up-cli-nodejs` folder inside the [default configuration location for your platform](https://github.com/sindresorhus/env-paths#pathsconfig).

Rather than work with the binary settings file directly, it's convenient to use the [`import-settings`](#import-settings) and [`export-settings`](#export-settings) commands, which convert the binary format to JSON.

#### `export-settings`

> Exports your account settings to a file named `settings.json` in the current directory.

**Important**: this file contains your private identity key and must be kept in a secure location!

#### `import-settings`

> Loads account settings from a `settings.json` file in the current directory.

#### `reset-settings`

> Deletes your account settings.

**Important:** this command completely removes the binary configuration file containing your identity key from your local machine. If you have not exported your settings, you will lose access to the identity and will need to generate and register a new one.

### Other commands

#### `insights`

The w3up service offers "insights" about uploaded content that can be retreived using one of the following commands:

- `w3up insights`
- `w3up insights-ws`

```sh
w3up insights <cid>
```

`w3up insights <cid>` will hit the w3up service and retrieve all currently known insights for that CID. 

The `w3up insights-ws` is similar, but will set up a websockets-based watch and print any further insights as they are discovered.

## Run tests

```sh
